Welcome to the first Dbo 1.69 (TW) open source

This project is created by fans for fans, so if you want to contribuite you can do it.
We want to emulate as We can a stable server of dbo with all systems but It is not easy
and will take a lot of time, If more people help in this more quickly all will see many 
advances.

###How I can Contribuite to the project?###

Well, if you have some knowledge about C++ you can help us to develop creating Forks
and sending Pull requests in Github.

If you don't know nothing about develop, you can contribuite in the future reporting bugs
but for now is not neccesary because the state of server is so basical
